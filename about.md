# Welcome to IvoryCirrus's LAB.

Ivorycirrus's LAB is a technical blog that covers software development.

Most of topics are focuse on introductions and experiments on mobile and web technologies. Although the posts do not require a high technical difficulty, but it show the process of solving problems and analyze what has been gained in. Hopefully, I want to help with an interest in similar problems.


### IvoryCirrus

I am a programmer who is developing applications that run on various devices or that run on systems connected to many devices.

I concern about connecting the device to the device and solving various problems while communicating them. And also interestered in improving the UI/UX structures and performances.
